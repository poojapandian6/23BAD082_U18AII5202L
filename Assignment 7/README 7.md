EXPERIMENT NO: 7
TITLE: Over-Plotting Reduction Techniques

OBJECTIVE:
To apply techniques that reduce visual clutter in large-scale datasets using R.

DESCRIPTION:
This experiment demonstrates the problem of over-plotting in big data
visualization and applies various techniques to improve clarity and
interpretability of plots.

DATASET:
Social media interaction dataset containing attributes such as:
Post_ID, Platform, Likes, Comments, Shares, Timestamp, User_ID.

TECHNIQUES USED:
1. Alpha Blending (Transparency)
2. Jittering
3. Aggregation
4. Binning (2D Density Plot)

TOOLS USED:
- R Programming Language
- ggplot2 package

PROCEDURE:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Plot a normal scatter plot to observe over-plotting.
3. Apply alpha blending to reduce overlap.
4. Apply jittering to separate overlapping points.
5. Aggregate data by platform to summarize engagement.
6. Use binning to visualize dense regions.

RESULT:
The applied techniques successfully reduce visual clutter and help in
better understanding engagement patterns in large datasets.

CONCLUSION:
Over-plotting reduction techniques improve visualization clarity and
support accurate analysis in big data and AI analytics.
